DMS experiments are not directed evolution in the conventional sense as they typically do not evolutionarily optimize a protein for a particular function through multiple rounds of selection. However, DMS experiments leverage many of the same approaches and yield useful insight into mutational landscapes for guiding subsequent directed evolution experiments. DMS experiments also generate large amounts of data that are highly useful for training machine learning models that can be used to guide directed evolution<sup>2</sup>. DMS has been applied to several types of mutational lesions<sup>3</sup> including codon mutations<sup>4</sup>,<sup>5</sup>,<sup>6</sup> as well as mutations that alter protein topology, including domain insertion<sup>7</sup>,<sup>8</sup>, circular permutation<sup>9</sup>, and truncation<sup>10</sup>. DMS experiments commonly analyze comprehensive codon mutagenesis (CCM). CCM is the process of generating combinatorial libraries where the amino acid encoded at each residue location within a protein is randomized to all possible amino acids.  CCM libraries can be generated using a variety of techniques. Nicking mutagenesis, codon tiling PCR11, inverse PCR12, transposon mutagenesis<sup>7</sup>,<sup>8</sup>,<sup>9</sup> and recently CCM libraries have been generated from pools of synthetic oligos that can be generated in high-throughput using oligo library synthesis (OLS) approaches<sup>6</sup>,<sup>8</sup>.

PFunkel is a modification to this method that increases mutational efficiency from 50-90%  that is achieved using the Kunkle method to nearly 100% using PFunkel.  - A uracil-containing ssDNA template is generating by propagating phagemid DNA containing the f1 phage origin and target gene in an Escherichia coli dut-1 ung-1 host and infecting the culture with the M13 helper phage and harvesting ssDNA from isolated phage particles.      - E.coli dut-1 ung-1 contains a heat-sensitive dUTPase and lacks uracil DNA glycosylase activity resulting in the production of uracil-containing DNA.  - Mutagenic oligonucleotide primers containing desired mutations are phosphorylated using T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (PNK) to enable subsequent ligation of DNA products using Taq ligase. - A mutated second strand is generated by mixing the phosphorylated oligonucleotide and the uracil-containing ssDNA template (4:1 molar ratio) along with PfuTurbo Cx DNA polymerase, Taq ligase, DTT, NAD+, and dNTPs. The mixture is then thermocycled to allow for denaturation, annealing, extension and ligation to generate a mutated second strand with a sealed nick.  - To generate a complementary mutated strand a second oligonucleotide primer that anneals outside of the mutated gene is then added to the reaction and the denaturation, annealing, extension and ligation cycle is repeated.  - To remove the uracil-containing ssDNA template uracil DNA glycosylase and exonuclease III are added to the reaction to generate nicks at the uracil containing bases and degrade the ssDNA template.  - DNA is then directly transformed into chemically competent cells or purified and electroporated into electrocompetent cells. - Method reportedly ddemonstrate close to 100% level opf efficiency for single codon mutations. - This method is highly extensible allowing for multiple codon positions to be targeted simultaneously in a single vector by leveraging multiple mutagenic primers and the inability of PfuTurbo to strand-displace at low extension temperatures (&lt;68C).  Single-tube generation of CCM libraries using pools of mutagenic oligos and using a low oligonucleotide primer to ssDNA template ratio (1:20) ensures only a single codon mutation in each vector.

The first report of this method dates back to 1996 (https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt0798-652). Since then, a wide variety of IVC protocols has been developed (see below). Correct mixing of oil, detergents, reaction components, and DNA ensures that each droplet contains only a single copy of the genotype or none at all.

FADS cytometers, on the other hand, can generate droplets that will encapsulate cell-free mixtures or cells for subsequent analysis and sorting. Despite their differences, both systems are used for high-throughput screening of particles and we will mostly focus on FACS applications as they are more common/accessible among laboratories. FACS cytometers are complex instruments that can analyze the fluorescent characteristics of individual \u201cparticles\u201d (e.g., cells, liposomes, beads, emulsion droplets, or polymer shells) at extremely high event rates (~10^7 per hour), isolating those with the desired signal for the desired trait</p>"},{"location":"FACS_FADS/#challenges","title":"Challenges","text":"<p>The main bottleneck in the usage of these systems is that they require the linkage of a genotype (a nucleic acid sequence) to a phenotype (a functional feature like binding or catalytic activity) in an ultrahigh-throughput context (Griffiths and Tawfik, 2006). In other words, the activity of an evolved molecule must be somehow linked to an output that is detectable by the FACS machine (usually a fluorescence signal). Once detected, the particle is sorted and its content can then be sequenced for establishing the genotype-phenotype relationship. Creating experimental setups for these types of studies can be very difficult depending on the system one is working with. If you work with the directed evolution of fluorescent proteins, the signal is directly provided by your protein, however, if you work with metabolic enzymes, for example, you might have to use indirect methods, such as fluorogenic substrates (if available), transcription factors that detect the product of your reaction, being induced by it, and activate the expression of a fluorescent protein, etc. Thus, for screenings involving indirect relationships, things can get a way more complicated. We will see below many examples addressing these challenges and, hopefully, they will serve as inspiration for your project!</p> <p>Firstly, we will briefly explore different FACS-based screening tech\u00adniques in directed evolution. They can be divided into six distinct categories according to the methods used to link the genotype and phenotype: - cell surface display (or in vivo display) of enzymes, - fluorescent protein-based methods, - entrapment of the product inside the cells, - in vitro compartmentalization, - single-cell/microcolony compartmentalization</p>"},{"location":"FACS_FADS/#cell-surface-display","title":"Cell surface display","text":"<p>This technique is based on the attachment of heterologous enzymes to the surface of microorganisms (the most common are: bacterial surface display (van Bloois et al., 2011)), yeast (yeast surface display (Boder and Wittrup, 1997)) or phages (phage surface display (Fernandez-Gacio et al., 2003)). Cell display offers ultra\u00adhigh-throughput capacity of up to 10^9 clones per round and allows direct contact between the enzyme and the added substrate, without requiring dif\u00adfusion through the cell membrane. However, this accessibility is at the same time a major drawback as the product is also freely diffusible. This drawback has been overcome by the development of cell microencapsulation techniques that imitate natural cell compartmentalization e.g., including the target enzyme in microemulsion droplets along with the substrate and products (Griffiths and Tawfik, 2006). The main advantages of the cell-in-droplet approach are its high-throughput capacity (~10^9 clones per round) and the reduced volume of the microemulsions (typically ~5 femtoliters), such that little substrate is needed (Aharoni et al., 2005). Very recently, novel screening platforms using polymer encapsulated cells have been developed like: (1) the cellular high-throughput encapsulation, solubilization and screening (CHESS) method to allow the encapsulation of libraries of approximately 10^8 mutants in a polymer to form cell-like microcapsules (Yong and Scott, 2015), (2) the polymer shell method that relies on fluorescent hydrogel formation around E. coli cells (Pitzler et al., 2014) or yeast cells (Vanella et al,. 2019). </p>"},{"location":"FACS_FADS/#in-vitro-display","title":"In vitro display","text":"<p>This method is based on the synthesis of the target protein through an in vitro translation system so that the genotype-phenotype linkage is achieved using molecules like ribosomes (ribosome display), puromycin (mRNA display), and the DNA replication initiator pro\u00adtein RepA (CIS display). More recently, novel in vitro display approaches have been reported that include liposome and megavalent bead display. Liposome display enables membrane proteins to be engineered, and it relies on their display on liposome membranes through the transcription and trans\u00adlation of a single DNA molecule using an encapsulated cell-free transla\u00adtion system (Fujii et al., 2014). Megavalent bead surface display allows tailor-made protein binders by laboratory evolution. In this method, the gene that encodes the protein of interest is attached to a bead by strong noncova\u00adlent interactions and the corresponding protein is displayed via a covalent thioether bond on the DNA (Diamante et al., 2013).</p>"},{"location":"FACS_FADS/#fluorescent-protein-based-methods","title":"Fluorescent protein-based methods","text":"<p>Due to their fluorescent properties, GFP and other fluorescent proteins (FPs) variants are ideal candidates for single-cell fluores\u00adcence analysis (you can find more about them in this amazingly resourceful website: https://www.fpbase.org/) and, therefore, they can be used in flow cytometry screening (Yang and Withers, 2009). The main advantages of GFP-based screening methods are their very high-throughput (\u223c10<sup>7\u201310</sup>8 clones per round) and the lack of expensive fluorescent substrates. On the other hand, the biggest challenge in this approach is to link the enzymatic func\u00adtion or activity of interest to the FPs expression, which can be very difficult depending on the studied protein. While the results achieved using this flow cytometry-based screen are promising, we must emphasize that flow cytometry is unlikely to serve as a standalone method. It is well-known that individual cells from bacterial cultures composed of a single genotype may display a range of phenotypes attributable to the stochastic nature of gene expression. As one considers that the selection criteria in flow cytometry experiments are determined by the phenotype of an individual cell, the inherent population heterogeneity of a bacterial culture, especially one containing a library of genotypes, makes the task of counter-selecting for one phenotype against another extremely challenging. For example, isolating a single bacterium displaying a low level of fluorescence does not guarantee that a culture grown from that single bacterium will possess, as a whole, those same fluorescence characteristics. With this in mind, the need for reinforcing a single-cell enrichment strategy with traditional assays, measuring average expression levels for an entire population, should be clear. As FP-based methods are becoming more and more common, a few examples for the directed evolution of different molecules can be found below: - Transcription factor directed evolution (usually targeted to ligand and/or DNA binding domains)  Tang and colleagues evolved a XylR regulator towards improved operating range, producing a more linear response of the system to the xylose inducer. In other words,  a system which was originally considered a bistable molecular switch (digital) was evolved into an analogic one. In this example, the link between genotype and protein function was established by a transcriptional interaction: XylR directly regulated the expression of a GFP gene and mutations affecting the function of the regulator could be readily tracked by the analysis and selection of cells with fluorescence levels that were different from the original system.  https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00225 In a different approach, Machado and colleagues evolved a repressor called PcaV to act as a biosensor for hydroxyl-substituted benzoic acids (such as vanillin and other closely related aromatic aldehydes). The overall system was similar to the one discussed above, linking protein function to fluorescent output through a transcriptional system directly repressed by PcaV which was alleviated by the usage of inducing molecules. After the generation of PcaV mutants, cells were screened through multiple rounds of counter-selection using FACS. In the first round, libraries were uninduced and selected for low fluorescence levels in order to remove non-functional repressors (cells expressing GFP without the inducer probably had non-functional repressors). On the second round, the previously sorted libraries were induced with the new molecule e.g. vanillin (that did not induce the original PcaV) and selected for GFP expression (functional mutants responding to vanillin). On the third round, the uninduced library was selected for cells with low fluorescence levels (this time with a less stringent cutoff than the first round). Finally, cells were again induced with the new molecule and selected for the most fluorescent cells. With this approach, a new biosensor capable of detecting vanillin and other related molecules was generated.   https://jbioleng.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13036-019-0214-z In our last example, a good combination of dry and wetlab was employed. The IPTG responsive Transcription Factor LacI has been computationally redesigned and mutated to recognize four new non-native inducers (Taylor et al., 2016). This study is a good example of how the combination of computation-guided mutagenesis based on the Rosetta algorithm and different diversification techniques (such as epPCR and saturation mutagenesis) can accelerate the discovery/generation of new molecular functions. In a counter-selection round, the mutant libraries were pre-screened for retained ability to repress a TolC reporter (a porin that allows entry of toxic colicin E1) by growth enrichment in the absence of inducers but in the presence of colicin E1. The enriched LacI libraries were then positively screened by FACS for their ability to activate production of GFP upon induction with different sugars, resulting in variants of LacI that were responsive to fucose, gentiobiose, lactitol and sucralose (Taylor et al., 2016). In this instance, no active counter-screening was performed against activation by IPTG, so nearly all mutants retained their ability to respond to IPTG, a phenotype that was reduced for some designs upon shuffling of mutations for activity screening. https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/48/1/e3/5645005?login=true  - Evolution of promoters/cis-regulatory regions For the study and directed evolution of promoter and cis-regulatory regions, a recent and extremely powerful strategy is the Sort-Seq. It relies on the power of FACS for sorting individual cells from libraries of regulatory sequences (controlling the expression of a FP) into different bins, according to their fluorescence levels. Later, each bin is sequenced through and the pool of regulatory sequences in each bin is analysed for the understanding, prediction and re-engineering of sequence-function (promoter-expression) relationships, https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-016-2533-5 https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-genom-083118-014845 Although not exactly a directed evolution project, the work from de Boer and colleagues (de Boer et al., 2019) provides an insightful resource for the generation and study of promoter libraries in yeast. Through the usage of random mutagenesis, a library of 100,000,000 promoters was cloned upstream of a Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP) gene and screened through FACS for different promoter activities (cells were binned according to their YFP expression levels). Each bin was then sequenced and a machine learning interpretable model was built with this data, allowing accurate prediction of the library and of independent test promoters that were designed de novo following the model rules. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0315-8 In a similar approach using E. coli cells, Urtecho and colleagues (Urtecho et al., 2019) explored the combinatorial space of sigma70 promoter elements in E. coli a combinatorial library of promoter elements was generated, cloned upstream a GFP reporter gene, sorted into bins by FACS and sequenced (both DNA and RNA-seq) for establishing the genotype (promoter sequence)-phenotype(GFP expression bins) relationships. One could use this strategy to evolve not only constitutive promoters but also inducible promoters (see see Rohlihil et al., 2017 for the Engineering a Formaldehyde-Inducible Promoter  and Yu et al., 2021 for the engineering of LacI based systems) towards different expression dynamics.  https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.biochem.7b01069 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20094-3 https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssynbio.7b00114</p> <ul> <li> <p>Directed evolution of enzymes by linking the product to a biosensor Although linking enzyme mutant libraries to FPs for FACS-based directed evolution is not a straightforward task, many groups have achieved it through the adoption of in vivo Biosensors. These biosensors can be any molecular sensor (usually protein or RNA-based one) that will interact with the product of a specific reaction and modulate the expression of a FP according to the product concentration. The biggest challenge is to find/engingineer sensors that can detect specific metabolites (in the native cellular concentrations) and also possess a good dynamic range for reliably connecting the input (product concentration) to the output (FP production). A comprehensive review in this topic has been written by Lin and colleagues and will probably give you some inspiring ideas if you decide to work on this topic. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0734975017300812 As an example of using a transcription factor to link the activity of an enzyme to the expression of a FP, let's consider the work of Kwon and collaborators (Kwon et al., 2018). In this study, the main goal was to change the substrate scope of a tryptophan-indole lyase from tryptophan-indole to  tyrosine-phenol. The expression of the FP in E. coli cells was controlled by a phenol-inducible transcription factor (DmpR). Using this genetic circuit-based biosensor for detection of phenolic components, the substrate scope of a tryptophan-indole lyase was re-engineered by directed evolution towards the desired tyrosine-phenol-lyase with complete loss of the original activity. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-20943-8 RNA sensors have also been used to screen enzymes from directed evolution with improved activities. For example, Michener and Smolke (Michener and Smolke, 2012) have targeted yCDM1, an enzyme that is not very efficient in demethylating caffeine to theophylline. A RNA riboswitch was used as a theophylline biosensor. The RNA switch was placed in the 3\u2032 UTR region of a fluorescent reporter gene. If no theophylline  was available, the poly-A tail of the mRNA was removed, leading to rapid degradation and low gene expression. Addition of the small molecule ligand favored a conformation in which the mRNA was stable and translation could proceed. Thus, the enzyme was mutagenized through EP-PCR and the RNA-based biosensor was used for screening with FACS. A mutant version of yCDM1 was obtained showing 33-fold increase in enzyme activity and 22-fold increase in selectivity. (Michener and Smolke, 2012). https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S109671761200047X?via%3Dihub</p> </li> <li> <p>Directed evolution of RNA/DNA aptamers/switches If a biosensor for your system is not available, why not try to develop one through directed evolution? This strategy, although very laborious, has been adopted by many groups with a special focus on RNA-based sensors. The first class of RNA-based sensors we will see are Riboswitches. They are biosensors typically composed of an aptamer domain, which recognizes a specific ligand, and an expression platform that couples ligand binding to a change in the FP expression. A traditional example of riboswitch directed evolution was demonstrated by Sean and Gallivan (Sean &amp; Gallivan, 2009).  Libraries (theophylline aptamer, followed by a sequence of eight randomized bases, the RBS, and the red-fluorescent reporter gene DsRed) were generated through random primers and cloned into plasmids for in vivo expression in E. coli. The system was coupled to a FP in a way that FP expression was increased in the presence of theophylline through the exposure of the RBS region, which was previously \u201cmasked\u201d by the mRNA secondary structure. A more recent study by Page and colleagues (Page et al., 2018) using the same system has also generated novel theophylline riboswitches by coupling a dual genetic selection and FACS.  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2615613/  https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00099 The second class of RNA-based sensors are toehold switches, A toehold switch is an RNA fragment with a secondary hairpin structure that is used to regulate translation. The toehold sequence contains a strong ribosome binding site (RBS) and a start codon that is followed by the coding sequence of a reporter gene. In the absence of a complementary sequence, the toehold is in its native hairpin conformation acting as a translational repressor and preventing ribosomes from binding to the RBS and thus from translating the reporter gene downstream. In the presence of a single stranded trigger complementary to the stem of the hairpin, the switch unfolds and exposes the ribosome binding site and the start codon and translation can be initiated. In a very comprehensive study, Green and colleagues (Green et al., 2014) have designed and characterized libraries of Toehold Switches, ending up with 26 sensors that could be used together with very little crosstalk and high dynamic range for the detection of endogenous mRNA in E. coli and the building of genetic circuits. The researchers used the NUPACK nucleic acid sequence design package (Zadeh et al., 2011) to generate libraries of de-novo-designed translational activators satisfying their desired parameters followed by synthesis of the oligos, cloning and in vivo testing of the libraries through FACS. In a more recent study,Angenent-Mari and colleagues ( Angenent-Mari et al., 2020) have taken one step further, using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to predict toehold switch function as a canonical riboswitch model in synthetic biology. To facilitate DNN training, they synthesized and characterized in vivo a dataset of 91,534 toehold switches spanning 23 viral genomes and 906 human transcription factors. DNNs trained on nucleotide sequences outperformed previous state-of-the-art thermodynamic and kinetic models. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867414012896 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18677-1</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"FACS_FADS/#entrapment-of-the-substrateproduct-inside-the-cells","title":"Entrapment of the substrate/product inside the cells","text":"<p>An alternative to cell surface dis\u00adplay strategies and FP-based screening methods are approaches in which the fluorescent product is trapped within the cell (Yang and Withers, 2009). This strategy faces two main challenges: (i) the obtention of commercial fluorogenic substrates for that specific reaction and (ii) the retention of such molecules inside of the cell. In this context, before starting a project based on this approach, one has to check for the availability of commercial fluorogenic substrates that cannot diffuse to the extracellular environment. The entrapment is usually achieved when the size, polarity, or other chemical proper\u00adties of the substrate are modified, resulting in the retention of the product within the cell.  As a successful example, Tan and colleagues (Tan et al., 2019) have improved the fucosylation catalytic efficiency of an \u03b11,3-FucT fucosidase by 14-fold after three rounds of directed evolution in E. coli. Two kinds of fluorescently labeled acceptor substrates (LacNAc derivatives) were designed and synthesized for cell entrapment. They were transported into the cell via the LacY transporter. The fucosylation reaction resulted in a trisaccharide product that accumulated inside of the cell as the LacY transport rate for such products was very low. Thus, fluorescence intensities of cells carried the information about the fucosylation efficiency allowing FACS-based screenings. Another possibility is to work with fluorogenic probes inside the cell that detect the substrate/product of the reaction. Sadler and colleagues (Sadler et al., 2018) have engineered a monoamine oxidase with improved activity towards a novel secondary amine substrate amine substrates based on the intracellular oxidation of a fluorogenic substrate by intracellular bacterial peroxidases. The authors expressed the amine oxidase variant library in E. coli and stained cells with a fluorogenic probe which is sensitive to oxidation by H2O2 (a byproduct of the monoamine oxidase reaction).  The probe was introduced into cells with the help of freeze-thaw cycles and chemicals that increased membrane permeability.  Finally, the drawback of substrate/product entrapment in the cell can also be overcome by the adoption of cell microencapsulation techniques that imitate natural cell compartmentalization as previously discussed in the Cell surface display section. As an example, a microdroplet-enabled FACS based screening strategy was also developed for improving cellulase activity. In this study, Ostafe et al. used double emulsions to encapsulate yeast cells expressing cellulase in microfluidic droplets (Ostafe et al., 2013). Glucose that was released by cellulose activity on carboxymethylcellulose substrate was detected via a hexose oxidase based coupled enzyme assay and enrichment of a positive population was demonstrated based on droplet fluorescence. https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/10/eaaw8451 https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2018/AN/C8AN00851E#!divAbstract</p>"},{"location":"FACS_FADS/#in-vitro-compartmentalization-ivc","title":"In vitro compartmentalization (IVC)","text":"<p>Microencapsulation can be performed in the absence of cells, directly producing the enzyme from the DNA library by in vitro protein translation.

Additionally, IVC prevents the gene diversity loss derived from the cloning and transformation steps by in vitro protein translation of the DNA used to generate the mutant library; moreover, it reduces experimental time by skipping the cell growth steps associated with cloning, transformation, and protein production (Mart\u00ednez and Schwaneberg, 2013).</p>"},{"location":"FACS_FADS/#single-cell-encapsulation","title":"Single-cell encapsulation","text":"<p>https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00103 Cells are the most straightforward way of protein production, yet they often lack the ability to take up the desired screening substrate or to retain the nascent product. They can be co-encapsulated with all compounds required for the screening reaction (substrates, cell lysis agents, buffer etc.) in an emulsion droplet and the enzyme of interest can be released from the cell in situ. This is an elegant approach, as it combines the advantages of cells and emulsion compartments: that is, the cells produce the enzyme; the emulsion retains the genotype\u2013 phenotype connection. Although high-throughput sorting rates are feasible with emulsions in a conventional flow cytometer or in custom-made chip devices, the restriction of compartmentalizing a maximum of one cell per emulsion droplet by Poisson\u2019s distribution causes most of the droplets to be empty. Therefore, the effective throughput is reduced. Nevertheless, from a sustainability point of view, microcompartments are superior to conventional assays, since only pico- or even femtoliters of reagents are used per sample as previously discussed by Agresti et al. Moreover, the compartmentalization of a single cell in such a small reaction volume typically results in high local enzyme concentrations during screening, which benefits the signal-to noise ratio. As previously discussed in the Fluorescent protein-based methods section, the stochastic nature of gene expression - phenotypic cell-to-cell variability - (Elowitz, 2002) can make FACS screenings misleading in some cases (Schaerli and Isalan, 2013). Imagine that due to noise, a single genotype (promoter sequence or synthetic circuit) can produce different fluorescence levels within the population. In this case, many cells will be sorted into different bins although having the same genotype. One way to tackle this problem is to use statistical methods after the sequencing step to find in which bin a single genotype is enriched (although it might be present in other bins). A second approach would be to select genotypes with high stochasticity, re-clone them and analyse the populational behaviour in both flow cytometry and plate reader. Lastly, an alternative method that has been gaining attention in recent years, is based on the gel encapsulation of microcolonies. With this technology, it is possible to use the high-throughput power of FACS for screening cell populations and circumventing the problem of high cell-to-cell variability (Weaver et al., 1991; Sahar et al., 1994; Zengler et al., 2002; Fischlechner et al., 2014; Meyer et al., 2015; Duarte et al., 2017).</p>"},{"location":"FACS_FADS/#protocol-and-application","title":"Protocol and application:","text":"<p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6047729/pdf/emss-78570.pdf https://sci-hub.se/https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acssynbio.7b00111</p>"},{"location":"FACS_FADS/#review","title":"Review:","text":"<p>https://www.mdpi.com/2072-666X/10/11/734/htm</p>"},{"location":"PACE_PANCE/","title":"Phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE) and Phage-assisted noncontinuous evolution (PANCE)","text":""},{"location":"PACE_PANCE/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>Phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE) and its noncontinuous variant (PANCE), developed by Esvelt et al. 2011<sup>1</sup>. This method offers the possibility to continuously mutate and select proteins with the help of M13 bacteriophages. Effectively, within the PACE process M13 is allowed to propagate whenever the gene of interest (GOI), which is incorporated into the phage genome, is active. PACE is one of a few directed evolution methods which are continuous. Non-continuous evolution methods usually start with the diversification of the target, then functional mutants from the library are selected. These functional mutants can then be used as a basis for the next round of diversification to improve their properties. Continuous evolution methods enable an uninterrupted diversification and selection of the target and thus promise faster results. For PACE more than 100 rounds of selection can be performed within 2 weeks (Miller et al. 2020). So why don\u2019t we use continuous evolution methods all the time? Continuous evolution methods are usually very complex to set-up. The crucial condition to make continuous evolution work is to apply selection pressure onto the GOI and not to the host organism. Some methods do so by introducing targeted mutagenesis methods (e.g. EvolvR (Halperin et al. 2018) or error-prone DNA-polymerases (Camps et al. 2013) or T7 RNA-polymerase systems (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0331-8)). In PACE, the target gene is encoded by an M13 phage and the selection pressure is applied to Escherichia coli cells (Badran et al. 2015). So how does PACE work? For PACE M13 bacteriophages are used, the same are used in Phage Display(link). M13 phages infect E. coli and establish a \u2018chronic infection\u2019 with an average generation time around 15 min (Barbas et al. 2001). The phage consists of a single-strand DNA genome encapsulated by five coat proteins. The coat protein relevant for PACE is pIII, which is essential for phage infectivity.  The basic principle of PACE is to replace the CDS of the pIII coat proteins by the CDS of the target gene which shall be evolved. The pIII gene is located on an accessory plasmid and its expression is activated in response to the activity of the protein of interest. Thus the only phage that bears a functioning protein of interest is allowed to propagate in the culture. Furthermore, the E. coli cells carry a mutagenesis plasmid which enables ongoing mutation of the selection phage. Through this set-up, two possible scenarios can happen when the selection phage infects a cell: The selection phage already carries a functional target gene or the mutation plasmid causes mutations which are beneficial for target functionality resulting in the target gene enabling pIII expression and infectious phages are produced and assembled, which can then infect other cells The selection phage carries a non-functional target gene or the mutation plasmid introduces mutations which inhibit the target functionality resulting in the target gene not enabling pIII expression and no infectious phages are produced In theory, PACE does not represent a method for targeted mutation since usually whole-genome mutators are used. However, due to the fast replication rate of the phages, the phages have a higher mutation rate and even if a selection plasmid is mutated and \u201cwrong\u201d phages are produced, these will be selected in the cells they infect next. PACE is usually performed in a continuous cultivation set-up. In this set-up, the E. coli host cells are cultivated as a fed-batch cultivation and these host cells are used as feed for the actual cultivation where the evolution happens \u2013 the lagoon. In the lagoon, the phages are able to replicate under a continuous feed of the host cells and a continuous outflow of waste (phages and cells). </p> <p>To better understand the basic principle, we will take a look at an example project using PACE: The evolution of a T7-RNA polymerase to recognize another promoter described by Esvelt et al. 2011. To evolve the polymerase, the CDS of pIII was replaced by the CDS of the T7-polymerase. The plasmid responsible for the selection pressure carried the CDS of pIII downstream of a T3/T7 hybrid promoter.  The selection phages are replicated using a strain that can express pIII, producing functional phages with genomes encoding the T7-RNA polymerase CDS. These phages can then infect the cells carrying the plasmid with pIII under the control of the T3/T7 hybrid promoter. If the mutation plasmid introduces mutations that enable the polymerase to recognize the new promoter, pIII is expressed and functional phages are assembled. These phages can then infect new host cells and will be mutated and selected again.  Next to the T7-RNA polymerase, directed evolution using PACE has been used to evolve for example TALE array proteins (Hubbard et al. 2015), Cas9 variants (Hu et al. 2018; Miller et al. 2020), protein-protein interactions using a two-hybrid system (Badran et al. 2016), tRNA/aminoacyl-synthetases (Bryson et al. 2017), and base-editors (Thuronyi et al. 2019).</p> <p>So what are the requirements and challenges using PACE to evolve your protein of choice? A very detailed protocol about requirements, how to set-up, and troubleshoot PACE (and PANCE) experiments is published by Miller et al. 2020.  In short: The crucial condition to use PACE is that the functionality of the target protein needs to be linkable to pIII expression.  Furthermore, the start of the directed evolution process can pose a challenge. When the target protein has little or no activity, even after mutation by the selection plasmid, the phages can be washed out of the continuous system. In this case, an adaption of the selection pressure or a switch to phage-assisted non-continuous evolution (PANCE) are possible choices. PANCE, in general, is probably the easier method when getting started with phage-assisted evolution, since it avoids the set-up of the continuous cultivation set-up.</p>"},{"location":"PACE_PANCE/#references","title":"References","text":"<p>Badran, A.

In recent years, different computational methods have emerged that take advantage of the thousands of sequences and structures deposited in gene and protein databases. Comprehensive reviews of these computational tools have been recently published (Damborsky and Brezovsky, 2014; Sebestova et al., 2014, Sequeiros-Borja et al., 2020), so here we will simply mention a few representative examples of the most common computational algorithms used to date. https://academic.oup.com/bib/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bib/bbaa150/5879227?login=true</p> <p>SCHEMA: This computational method allows libraries to be designed by recombination of several homologous sequences (with as little as 55 % identity) while maximizing the number of folded proteins (Voigt et al., 2002). SCHEMA predicts the fragments that must be inherited in the same parent, thereby allowing the computational selection of blocks from which novel proteins (chimeras) can be assembled. The selection of crossover locations is based on a metric for disruption, defined as the number of interactions of a hybrid protein that are broken when a given pattern of fragments is inherited from each of the parents (ie, the pairs of residues within 4.5 \u00c5 of each other that are not present as the same pair in any of the parents\u2014defined as SCHEMA energy). This method requires a multiple sequence alignment of the parental sequences, a PDB file, and a UNIX-based computer.

MAP is used to predict the quality of the mutant library based on the epPCR method chosen and the nucleotide composition of the target gene. It works at three levels of information using three distinct indicators: (1) the protein structure indicator provides data about the likelihood of introducing stop codons and residues that destabilize the helical structure (Pro, Gly), (2) the amino acid diversity indicator shows the proportion of variants with preserved amino acids (ie, amino acids that do not change with a single nucleotide substitution\u2014silent mutations\u2014) and the average number of amino acid substitutions after a single nucleotide change, and (3) the chemical diversity indicator provides the chemical diversity generated in terms of amino acid substitution (aliphatic, aromatic, neutral, charged). The new version of the server (MAP2.0 3D) permits further mapping of the sequence indicators onto the target protein\u2019s 3D structure, correlating the pattern of amino acid substitution with structural information regarding local interactions solvent accessibility, residual motility, and secondary elements.

Considering its broad modeling capabilities, Rosetta consistently ranks highly when compared to other leading methods created for highly specialized protein modeling and design tasks. Developed for over two decades by a global community of scientists at more than 60 institutions, Rosetta has undergone multiple refactorings, and now comprises over three million lines of code. Among its many uses, the most common applications are: Predicting protein structures; modeling protein\u2013protein and DNA/RNA-protein complexes; design/modeling antibodies and other immune system proteins;  designing new proteins and functions. A limitation of Rosetta is the need for a local installation and compilation in a Unix-like environment. Webservers provide a user-friendly alternative and a number of independent servers have emerged in our community. However, implementing and maintaining such servers comes at a substantial cost. To make it easier to provide protocols webservers, ROSIE (Rosetta Online Server that Includes Everyone) (http://rosie.rosettacommons.org/) implements a simple framework for \u201cserverification\u201d of protocols.

By building models directly from data, machine learning has proven to be a powerful, efficient, and versatile tool for a variety of applications, such as extracting abstract concepts from text and images or beating humans at our most complex games (11, 12). Previous applications of machine learning in protein engineering have identified beneficial mutations (13) and optimal combinations of protein fragments (14) for increased enzyme activity and protein stability, as reviewed recently (15).  Example/Application: Here we use machine learning to enhance directed evolution by using combinatorial libraries of mutations to explore sequence space more efficiently than conventional directed evolution with single mutation walks. The size of a mutant library grows exponentially with the number of residues considered for mutation and quickly becomes intractable for experimental screening. However, by leveraging in silico models built based on sampling of a combinatorial library, machine learning assists directed evolution to make multiple mutations simultaneously and traverse fitness landscapes more efficiently. In the machine learning-assisted directed evolution strategy presented here, multiple amino acid residues are randomized in each generation. Sequence\u2013function information sampled from the large combinatorial library is then used to predict a restricted library with an increased probability of containing variants with high fitness. The best-performing variants from the predicted libraries are chosen as the starting points for the next round of evolution, from which further improved variants are identified.  https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/18/8852.full.pdf</li> </ol> <p>A good and concise example of combining computational and experimental approaches: In our last example, a good combination of dry and wetlab was employed. The IPTG responsive Transcription Factor LacI has been computationally redesigned and mutated to recognize four new non-native inducers (Taylor et al., 2016). This study is a good example of how the combination of computation-guided mutagenesis based on the Rosetta algorithm and different diversification techniques (such as epPCR and saturation mutagenesis) can accelerate the discovery/generation of new molecular functions. In a counter-selection round, the mutant libraries were pre-screened for retained ability to repress a TolC reporter (a porin that allows entry of toxic colicin E1) by growth enrichment in the absence of inducers but in the presence of colicin E1. The enriched LacI libraries were then positively screened by FACS for their ability to activate production of GFP upon induction with different sugars, resulting in variants of LacI that were responsive to fucose, gentiobiose, lactitol and sucralose (Taylor et al., 2016). In this instance, no active counter-screening was performed against activation by IPTG, so nearly all mutants retained their ability to respond to IPTG, a phenotype that was reduced for some designs upon shuffling of mutations for activity screening. https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/48/1/e3/5645005?login=true</p> <p>Reviews Computational tools for enzyme improvement: why everyone can \u2013 and should \u2013 use them https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1367593117300248 Computational Tools for Designing Smart Libraries https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007%2F978-1-4939-1053-3_20 Protein computational design - recent review https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0734975021000021 From directed evolution to computational enzyme engineering\u2014A review https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aic.16847 Other examples: CADEE: Computer-Aided Directed Evolution of Enzymes https://journals.iucr.org/m/issues/2017/01/00/be5274/index.html Machine learning-assisted directed protein evolution with combinatorial libraries https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/18/8852.full.pdf Principles of Machine Learning Guided Protein Engineering https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/37365914 Discovery of Novel Gain-of-Function Mutations Guided by Structure-Based Deep Learning https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00345 Deep Dive into Machine Learning Models for Protein Engineering https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.0c00073 Underrated Machine Learning Papers for Protein Design https://medium.com/proteinqure/underrated-machine-learning-papers-for-protein-design-applications-a846e294330 Deep Learning in Protein Structural Modeling and Design https://www.cell.com/patterns/pdf/S2666-3899(20)30190-2.pdf</p>"},{"location":"cont_de_methods/","title":"Continuous directed evolution methods","text":"<p>Continuous directed evolution (CDE) methods offer a significant advantage over the discrete ones as they:</p> <ul> <li>Involve less interrogation from the experimenter.

In this technique, a gene encoding a protein of interest (POI) is expressed in frame (i.e. as a fusion) with the phage coat protein gene, causing the phage to \"display\" the protein on its outside. The phage itself serves as a 'vessel' connecting the displayed phenotype and genotype. The displaying phages can then be screened against various bait molecules (proteins, peptides or DNA sequences) for specific interaction with them. In this way, large libraries of proteins can be screened and amplified in a process called in vitro selection. The most common bacteriophages used in phage display are M13 and FD filamentous phage, though T4, T7, and \u03bb phage are also used.</p>"},{"location":"phage_display/#general-principle","title":"General principle.","text":"<p>In the M13 phage display, the DNA encoding POI is expressed N-terminally with either pIII or pVIII gene, which encodes the minor and major coat proteins. The pIII gene is responsible for binding to E.coli via associating with the F' pilus thereby triggering infection. Certain E.coli strains are suitable for this purpose: TG1, SS320, ER2738, or XL1-Blue. Fusing POI to the pIII N-terminus ensures correct exposure of a target peptide for the interaction with a bait molecule. The POIs of sizes less than 50 amino acids largely don't affect the main function of the coat protein - phage infectivity. For larger POIs a \"phagemid\" vector is used (a simplified display construct vector) that encodes a fused version of the coat-protein with the intact coat protein (and other phage lifecyle-components) provided by a helper phage. Upon infection, intact pIII competes with POI-pIII fusion resulting in a large portion of the phage population not displaying POI and a small portion that would contain on average a single copy of POI-pIII per phage particle. Use of phagemid is beneficial in two ways: (1) smaller vector enables higher transformation efficiency hence higher genetic diversity libraries; (2) use of monovalent display of POI on phages often results in selection of higher affinity binders due to the absence of an 'avidity' effect.</p> <p></p> <p>The bait molecules are typically immobilised on the surface of a microtiter plate. Phages that tightly interact with the bait will remain attached to the plate while the majority of the phage population will be washed away. The remaining phage are then eluted and amplified again in the next round of bacterial infection resulting in a phage mixture enriched with phages that bind the target molecule. This process is referred to as panning is typically repeated a number of times to establish high level of enrichment of phages encoding tight-binder POIs.

Elution is usually carried out by using trypsin to digest the bait protein and presented binding protein, thus releasing the bound phage, or by using low pH buffer to dissociate electrostatic interactions.

DMS experiments are not directed evolution in the conventional sense as they typically do not evolutionarily optimize a protein for a particular function through multiple rounds of selection. However, DMS experiments leverage many of the same approaches and yield useful insight into mutational landscapes for guiding subsequent directed evolution experiments. DMS experiments also generate large amounts of data that are highly useful for training machine learning models that can be used to guide directed evolution<sup>2</sup>. DMS has been applied to several types of mutational lesions<sup>3</sup> including codon mutations<sup>4</sup>,<sup>5</sup>,<sup>6</sup> as well as mutations that alter protein topology, including domain insertion<sup>7</sup>,<sup>8</sup>, circular permutation<sup>9</sup>, and truncation<sup>10</sup>. DMS experiments commonly analyze comprehensive codon mutagenesis (CCM). CCM is the process of generating combinatorial libraries where the amino acid encoded at each residue location within a protein is randomized to all possible amino acids.

PFunkel is a modification to this method that increases mutational efficiency from 50-90%  that is achieved using the Kunkle method to nearly 100% using PFunkel.  - A uracil-containing ssDNA template is generating by propagating phagemid DNA containing the f1 phage origin and target gene in an Escherichia coli dut-1 ung-1 host and infecting the culture with the M13 helper phage and harvesting ssDNA from isolated phage particles.      - E.coli dut-1 ung-1 contains a heat-sensitive dUTPase and lacks uracil DNA glycosylase activity resulting in the production of uracil-containing DNA.  - Mutagenic oligonucleotide primers containing desired mutations are phosphorylated using T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (PNK) to enable subsequent ligation of DNA products using Taq ligase. - A mutated second strand is generated by mixing the phosphorylated oligonucleotide and the uracil-containing ssDNA template (4:1 molar ratio) along with PfuTurbo Cx DNA polymerase, Taq ligase, DTT, NAD+, and dNTPs. The mixture is then thermocycled to allow for denaturation, annealing, extension and ligation to generate a mutated second strand with a sealed nick.  - To generate a complementary mutated strand a second oligonucleotide primer that anneals outside of the mutated gene is then added to the reaction and the denaturation, annealing, extension and ligation cycle is repeated.  - To remove the uracil-containing ssDNA template uracil DNA glycosylase and exonuclease III are added to the reaction to generate nicks at the uracil containing bases and degrade the ssDNA template.  - DNA is then directly transformed into chemically competent cells or purified and electroporated into electrocompetent cells. - Method reportedly ddemonstrate close to 100% level opf efficiency for single codon mutations. - This method is highly extensible allowing for multiple codon positions to be targeted simultaneously in a single vector by leveraging multiple mutagenic primers and the inability of PfuTurbo to strand-displace at low extension temperatures (&lt;68C).  Single-tube generation of CCM libraries using pools of mutagenic oligos and using a low oligonucleotide primer to ssDNA template ratio (1:20) ensures only a single codon mutation in each vector.

FADS cytometers, on the other hand, can generate droplets that will encapsulate cell-free mixtures or cells for subsequent analysis and sorting. Despite their differences, both systems are used for high-throughput screening of particles and we will mostly focus on FACS applications as they are more common/accessible among laboratories. FACS cytometers are complex instruments that can analyze the fluorescent characteristics of individual \u201cparticles\u201d (e.g., cells, liposomes, beads, emulsion droplets, or polymer shells) at extremely high event rates (~10^7 per hour), isolating those with the desired signal for the desired trait</p>"},{"location":"resources/FACS_FADS/#challenges","title":"Challenges","text":"<p>The main bottleneck in the usage of these systems is that they require the linkage of a genotype (a nucleic acid sequence) to a phenotype (a functional feature like binding or catalytic activity) in an ultrahigh-throughput context (Griffiths and Tawfik, 2006). In other words, the activity of an evolved molecule must be somehow linked to an output that is detectable by the FACS machine (usually a fluorescence signal). Once detected, the particle is sorted and its content can then be sequenced for establishing the genotype-phenotype relationship. Creating experimental setups for these types of studies can be very difficult depending on the system one is working with. If you work with the directed evolution of fluorescent proteins, the signal is directly provided by your protein, however, if you work with metabolic enzymes, for example, you might have to use indirect methods, such as fluorogenic substrates (if available), transcription factors that detect the product of your reaction, being induced by it, and activate the expression of a fluorescent protein, etc. Thus, for screenings involving indirect relationships, things can get a way more complicated. We will see below many examples addressing these challenges and, hopefully, they will serve as inspiration for your project!</p> <p>Firstly, we will briefly explore different FACS-based screening tech\u00adniques in directed evolution. They can be divided into six distinct categories according to the methods used to link the genotype and phenotype: - cell surface display (or in vivo display) of enzymes, - fluorescent protein-based methods, - entrapment of the product inside the cells, - in vitro compartmentalization, - single-cell/microcolony compartmentalization</p>"},{"location":"resources/FACS_FADS/#cell-surface-display","title":"Cell surface display","text":"<p>This technique is based on the attachment of heterologous enzymes to the surface of microorganisms (the most common are: bacterial surface display (van Bloois et al., 2011)), yeast (yeast surface display (Boder and Wittrup, 1997)) or phages (phage surface display (Fernandez-Gacio et al., 2003)). Cell display offers ultra\u00adhigh-throughput capacity of up to 10^9 clones per round and allows direct contact between the enzyme and the added substrate, without requiring dif\u00adfusion through the cell membrane. However, this accessibility is at the same time a major drawback as the product is also freely diffusible. This drawback has been overcome by the development of cell microencapsulation techniques that imitate natural cell compartmentalization e.g., including the target enzyme in microemulsion droplets along with the substrate and products (Griffiths and Tawfik, 2006). The main advantages of the cell-in-droplet approach are its high-throughput capacity (~10^9 clones per round) and the reduced volume of the microemulsions (typically ~5 femtoliters), such that little substrate is needed (Aharoni et al., 2005). Very recently, novel screening platforms using polymer encapsulated cells have been developed like: (1) the cellular high-throughput encapsulation, solubilization and screening (CHESS) method to allow the encapsulation of libraries of approximately 10^8 mutants in a polymer to form cell-like microcapsules (Yong and Scott, 2015), (2) the polymer shell method that relies on fluorescent hydrogel formation around E. coli cells (Pitzler et al., 2014) or yeast cells (Vanella et al,. 2019). </p>"},{"location":"resources/FACS_FADS/#in-vitro-display","title":"In vitro display","text":"<p>This method is based on the synthesis of the target protein through an in vitro translation system so that the genotype-phenotype linkage is achieved using molecules like ribosomes (ribosome display), puromycin (mRNA display), and the DNA replication initiator pro\u00adtein RepA (CIS display). More recently, novel in vitro display approaches have been reported that include liposome and megavalent bead display. Liposome display enables membrane proteins to be engineered, and it relies on their display on liposome membranes through the transcription and trans\u00adlation of a single DNA molecule using an encapsulated cell-free transla\u00adtion system (Fujii et al., 2014). Megavalent bead surface display allows tailor-made protein binders by laboratory evolution. In this method, the gene that encodes the protein of interest is attached to a bead by strong noncova\u00adlent interactions and the corresponding protein is displayed via a covalent thioether bond on the DNA (Diamante et al., 2013).</p>"},{"location":"resources/FACS_FADS/#fluorescent-protein-based-methods","title":"Fluorescent protein-based methods","text":"<p>Due to their fluorescent properties, GFP and other fluorescent proteins (FPs) variants are ideal candidates for single-cell fluores\u00adcence analysis (you can find more about them in this amazingly resourceful website: https://www.fpbase.org/) and, therefore, they can be used in flow cytometry screening (Yang and Withers, 2009). The main advantages of GFP-based screening methods are their very high-throughput (\u223c10<sup>7\u201310</sup>8 clones per round) and the lack of expensive fluorescent substrates. On the other hand, the biggest challenge in this approach is to link the enzymatic func\u00adtion or activity of interest to the FPs expression, which can be very difficult depending on the studied protein. While the results achieved using this flow cytometry-based screen are promising, we must emphasize that flow cytometry is unlikely to serve as a standalone method. It is well-known that individual cells from bacterial cultures composed of a single genotype may display a range of phenotypes attributable to the stochastic nature of gene expression. As one considers that the selection criteria in flow cytometry experiments are determined by the phenotype of an individual cell, the inherent population heterogeneity of a bacterial culture, especially one containing a library of genotypes, makes the task of counter-selecting for one phenotype against another extremely challenging. For example, isolating a single bacterium displaying a low level of fluorescence does not guarantee that a culture grown from that single bacterium will possess, as a whole, those same fluorescence characteristics. With this in mind, the need for reinforcing a single-cell enrichment strategy with traditional assays, measuring average expression levels for an entire population, should be clear. As FP-based methods are becoming more and more common, a few examples for the directed evolution of different molecules can be found below: - Transcription factor directed evolution (usually targeted to ligand and/or DNA binding domains)  Tang and colleagues evolved a XylR regulator towards improved operating range, producing a more linear response of the system to the xylose inducer. In other words,  a system which was originally considered a bistable molecular switch (digital) was evolved into an analogic one. In this example, the link between genotype and protein function was established by a transcriptional interaction: XylR directly regulated the expression of a GFP gene and mutations affecting the function of the regulator could be readily tracked by the analysis and selection of cells with fluorescence levels that were different from the original system.  https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00225 In a different approach, Machado and colleagues evolved a repressor called PcaV to act as a biosensor for hydroxyl-substituted benzoic acids (such as vanillin and other closely related aromatic aldehydes). The overall system was similar to the one discussed above, linking protein function to fluorescent output through a transcriptional system directly repressed by PcaV which was alleviated by the usage of inducing molecules. After the generation of PcaV mutants, cells were screened through multiple rounds of counter-selection using FACS. In the first round, libraries were uninduced and selected for low fluorescence levels in order to remove non-functional repressors (cells expressing GFP without the inducer probably had non-functional repressors). On the second round, the previously sorted libraries were induced with the new molecule e.g. vanillin (that did not induce the original PcaV) and selected for GFP expression (functional mutants responding to vanillin). On the third round, the uninduced library was selected for cells with low fluorescence levels (this time with a less stringent cutoff than the first round). Finally, cells were again induced with the new molecule and selected for the most fluorescent cells. With this approach, a new biosensor capable of detecting vanillin and other related molecules was generated.   https://jbioleng.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13036-019-0214-z In our last example, a good combination of dry and wetlab was employed. The IPTG responsive Transcription Factor LacI has been computationally redesigned and mutated to recognize four new non-native inducers (Taylor et al., 2016). This study is a good example of how the combination of computation-guided mutagenesis based on the Rosetta algorithm and different diversification techniques (such as epPCR and saturation mutagenesis) can accelerate the discovery/generation of new molecular functions. In a counter-selection round, the mutant libraries were pre-screened for retained ability to repress a TolC reporter (a porin that allows entry of toxic colicin E1) by growth enrichment in the absence of inducers but in the presence of colicin E1. The enriched LacI libraries were then positively screened by FACS for their ability to activate production of GFP upon induction with different sugars, resulting in variants of LacI that were responsive to fucose, gentiobiose, lactitol and sucralose (Taylor et al., 2016). In this instance, no active counter-screening was performed against activation by IPTG, so nearly all mutants retained their ability to respond to IPTG, a phenotype that was reduced for some designs upon shuffling of mutations for activity screening. https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/48/1/e3/5645005?login=true  - Evolution of promoters/cis-regulatory regions For the study and directed evolution of promoter and cis-regulatory regions, a recent and extremely powerful strategy is the Sort-Seq. It relies on the power of FACS for sorting individual cells from libraries of regulatory sequences (controlling the expression of a FP) into different bins, according to their fluorescence levels. Later, each bin is sequenced through and the pool of regulatory sequences in each bin is analysed for the understanding, prediction and re-engineering of sequence-function (promoter-expression) relationships, https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-016-2533-5 https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-genom-083118-014845 Although not exactly a directed evolution project, the work from de Boer and colleagues (de Boer et al., 2019) provides an insightful resource for the generation and study of promoter libraries in yeast. Through the usage of random mutagenesis, a library of 100,000,000 promoters was cloned upstream of a Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP) gene and screened through FACS for different promoter activities (cells were binned according to their YFP expression levels). Each bin was then sequenced and a machine learning interpretable model was built with this data, allowing accurate prediction of the library and of independent test promoters that were designed de novo following the model rules. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0315-8 In a similar approach using E. coli cells, Urtecho and colleagues (Urtecho et al., 2019) explored the combinatorial space of sigma70 promoter elements in E. coli a combinatorial library of promoter elements was generated, cloned upstream a GFP reporter gene, sorted into bins by FACS and sequenced (both DNA and RNA-seq) for establishing the genotype (promoter sequence)-phenotype(GFP expression bins) relationships. One could use this strategy to evolve not only constitutive promoters but also inducible promoters (see see Rohlihil et al., 2017 for the Engineering a Formaldehyde-Inducible Promoter  and Yu et al., 2021 for the engineering of LacI based systems) towards different expression dynamics.  https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.biochem.7b01069 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20094-3 https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssynbio.7b00114</p> <ul> <li> <p>Directed evolution of enzymes by linking the product to a biosensor Although linking enzyme mutant libraries to FPs for FACS-based directed evolution is not a straightforward task, many groups have achieved it through the adoption of in vivo Biosensors. These biosensors can be any molecular sensor (usually protein or RNA-based one) that will interact with the product of a specific reaction and modulate the expression of a FP according to the product concentration. The biggest challenge is to find/engingineer sensors that can detect specific metabolites (in the native cellular concentrations) and also possess a good dynamic range for reliably connecting the input (product concentration) to the output (FP production). A comprehensive review in this topic has been written by Lin and colleagues and will probably give you some inspiring ideas if you decide to work on this topic. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0734975017300812 As an example of using a transcription factor to link the activity of an enzyme to the expression of a FP, let's consider the work of Kwon and collaborators (Kwon et al., 2018). In this study, the main goal was to change the substrate scope of a tryptophan-indole lyase from tryptophan-indole to  tyrosine-phenol. The expression of the FP in E. coli cells was controlled by a phenol-inducible transcription factor (DmpR). Using this genetic circuit-based biosensor for detection of phenolic components, the substrate scope of a tryptophan-indole lyase was re-engineered by directed evolution towards the desired tyrosine-phenol-lyase with complete loss of the original activity. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-20943-8 RNA sensors have also been used to screen enzymes from directed evolution with improved activities. For example, Michener and Smolke (Michener and Smolke, 2012) have targeted yCDM1, an enzyme that is not very efficient in demethylating caffeine to theophylline. A RNA riboswitch was used as a theophylline biosensor. The RNA switch was placed in the 3\u2032 UTR region of a fluorescent reporter gene. If no theophylline  was available, the poly-A tail of the mRNA was removed, leading to rapid degradation and low gene expression. Addition of the small molecule ligand favored a conformation in which the mRNA was stable and translation could proceed. Thus, the enzyme was mutagenized through EP-PCR and the RNA-based biosensor was used for screening with FACS. A mutant version of yCDM1 was obtained showing 33-fold increase in enzyme activity and 22-fold increase in selectivity. (Michener and Smolke, 2012). https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S109671761200047X?via%3Dihub</p> </li> <li> <p>Directed evolution of RNA/DNA aptamers/switches If a biosensor for your system is not available, why not try to develop one through directed evolution? This strategy, although very laborious, has been adopted by many groups with a special focus on RNA-based sensors. The first class of RNA-based sensors we will see are Riboswitches. They are biosensors typically composed of an aptamer domain, which recognizes a specific ligand, and an expression platform that couples ligand binding to a change in the FP expression. A traditional example of riboswitch directed evolution was demonstrated by Sean and Gallivan (Sean &amp; Gallivan, 2009).  Libraries (theophylline aptamer, followed by a sequence of eight randomized bases, the RBS, and the red-fluorescent reporter gene DsRed) were generated through random primers and cloned into plasmids for in vivo expression in E. coli. The system was coupled to a FP in a way that FP expression was increased in the presence of theophylline through the exposure of the RBS region, which was previously \u201cmasked\u201d by the mRNA secondary structure. A more recent study by Page and colleagues (Page et al., 2018) using the same system has also generated novel theophylline riboswitches by coupling a dual genetic selection and FACS.  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2615613/  https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00099 The second class of RNA-based sensors are toehold switches, A toehold switch is an RNA fragment with a secondary hairpin structure that is used to regulate translation. The toehold sequence contains a strong ribosome binding site (RBS) and a start codon that is followed by the coding sequence of a reporter gene. In the absence of a complementary sequence, the toehold is in its native hairpin conformation acting as a translational repressor and preventing ribosomes from binding to the RBS and thus from translating the reporter gene downstream. In the presence of a single stranded trigger complementary to the stem of the hairpin, the switch unfolds and exposes the ribosome binding site and the start codon and translation can be initiated. In a very comprehensive study, Green and colleagues (Green et al., 2014) have designed and characterized libraries of Toehold Switches, ending up with 26 sensors that could be used together with very little crosstalk and high dynamic range for the detection of endogenous mRNA in E. coli and the building of genetic circuits. The researchers used the NUPACK nucleic acid sequence design package (Zadeh et al., 2011) to generate libraries of de-novo-designed translational activators satisfying their desired parameters followed by synthesis of the oligos, cloning and in vivo testing of the libraries through FACS. In a more recent study,Angenent-Mari and colleagues ( Angenent-Mari et al., 2020) have taken one step further, using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to predict toehold switch function as a canonical riboswitch model in synthetic biology. To facilitate DNN training, they synthesized and characterized in vivo a dataset of 91,534 toehold switches spanning 23 viral genomes and 906 human transcription factors. DNNs trained on nucleotide sequences outperformed previous state-of-the-art thermodynamic and kinetic models. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867414012896 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18677-1</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"resources/FACS_FADS/#entrapment-of-the-substrateproduct-inside-the-cells","title":"Entrapment of the substrate/product inside the cells","text":"<p>An alternative to cell surface dis\u00adplay strategies and FP-based screening methods are approaches in which the fluorescent product is trapped within the cell (Yang and Withers, 2009). This strategy faces two main challenges: (i) the obtention of commercial fluorogenic substrates for that specific reaction and (ii) the retention of such molecules inside of the cell. In this context, before starting a project based on this approach, one has to check for the availability of commercial fluorogenic substrates that cannot diffuse to the extracellular environment. The entrapment is usually achieved when the size, polarity, or other chemical proper\u00adties of the substrate are modified, resulting in the retention of the product within the cell.  As a successful example, Tan and colleagues (Tan et al., 2019) have improved the fucosylation catalytic efficiency of an \u03b11,3-FucT fucosidase by 14-fold after three rounds of directed evolution in E. coli. Two kinds of fluorescently labeled acceptor substrates (LacNAc derivatives) were designed and synthesized for cell entrapment. They were transported into the cell via the LacY transporter. The fucosylation reaction resulted in a trisaccharide product that accumulated inside of the cell as the LacY transport rate for such products was very low. Thus, fluorescence intensities of cells carried the information about the fucosylation efficiency allowing FACS-based screenings. Another possibility is to work with fluorogenic probes inside the cell that detect the substrate/product of the reaction. Sadler and colleagues (Sadler et al., 2018) have engineered a monoamine oxidase with improved activity towards a novel secondary amine substrate amine substrates based on the intracellular oxidation of a fluorogenic substrate by intracellular bacterial peroxidases. The authors expressed the amine oxidase variant library in E. coli and stained cells with a fluorogenic probe which is sensitive to oxidation by H2O2 (a byproduct of the monoamine oxidase reaction).  The probe was introduced into cells with the help of freeze-thaw cycles and chemicals that increased membrane permeability.  Finally, the drawback of substrate/product entrapment in the cell can also be overcome by the adoption of cell microencapsulation techniques that imitate natural cell compartmentalization as previously discussed in the Cell surface display section. As an example, a microdroplet-enabled FACS based screening strategy was also developed for improving cellulase activity. In this study, Ostafe et al. used double emulsions to encapsulate yeast cells expressing cellulase in microfluidic droplets (Ostafe et al., 2013). Glucose that was released by cellulose activity on carboxymethylcellulose substrate was detected via a hexose oxidase based coupled enzyme assay and enrichment of a positive population was demonstrated based on droplet fluorescence. https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/10/eaaw8451 https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2018/AN/C8AN00851E#!divAbstract</p>"},{"location":"resources/FACS_FADS/#in-vitro-compartmentalization-ivc","title":"In vitro compartmentalization (IVC)","text":"<p>Microencapsulation can be performed in the absence of cells, directly producing the enzyme from the DNA library by in vitro protein translation.

Additionally, IVC prevents the gene diversity loss derived from the cloning and transformation steps by in vitro protein translation of the DNA used to generate the mutant library; moreover, it reduces experimental time by skipping the cell growth steps associated with cloning, transformation, and protein production (Mart\u00ednez and Schwaneberg, 2013).</p>"},{"location":"resources/FACS_FADS/#single-cell-encapsulation","title":"Single-cell encapsulation","text":"<p>https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00103 Cells are the most straightforward way of protein production, yet they often lack the ability to take up the desired screening substrate or to retain the nascent product. They can be co-encapsulated with all compounds required for the screening reaction (substrates, cell lysis agents, buffer etc.) in an emulsion droplet and the enzyme of interest can be released from the cell in situ. This is an elegant approach, as it combines the advantages of cells and emulsion compartments: that is, the cells produce the enzyme; the emulsion retains the genotype\u2013 phenotype connection. Although high-throughput sorting rates are feasible with emulsions in a conventional flow cytometer or in custom-made chip devices, the restriction of compartmentalizing a maximum of one cell per emulsion droplet by Poisson\u2019s distribution causes most of the droplets to be empty. Therefore, the effective throughput is reduced. Nevertheless, from a sustainability point of view, microcompartments are superior to conventional assays, since only pico- or even femtoliters of reagents are used per sample as previously discussed by Agresti et al. Moreover, the compartmentalization of a single cell in such a small reaction volume typically results in high local enzyme concentrations during screening, which benefits the signal-to noise ratio. As previously discussed in the Fluorescent protein-based methods section, the stochastic nature of gene expression - phenotypic cell-to-cell variability - (Elowitz, 2002) can make FACS screenings misleading in some cases (Schaerli and Isalan, 2013). Imagine that due to noise, a single genotype (promoter sequence or synthetic circuit) can produce different fluorescence levels within the population. In this case, many cells will be sorted into different bins although having the same genotype. One way to tackle this problem is to use statistical methods after the sequencing step to find in which bin a single genotype is enriched (although it might be present in other bins). A second approach would be to select genotypes with high stochasticity, re-clone them and analyse the populational behaviour in both flow cytometry and plate reader. Lastly, an alternative method that has been gaining attention in recent years, is based on the gel encapsulation of microcolonies. With this technology, it is possible to use the high-throughput power of FACS for screening cell populations and circumventing the problem of high cell-to-cell variability (Weaver et al., 1991; Sahar et al., 1994; Zengler et al., 2002; Fischlechner et al., 2014; Meyer et al., 2015; Duarte et al., 2017).</p>"},{"location":"resources/FACS_FADS/#protocol-and-application","title":"Protocol and application:","text":"<p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6047729/pdf/emss-78570.pdf https://sci-hub.se/https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acssynbio.7b00111</p>"},{"location":"resources/FACS_FADS/#review","title":"Review:","text":"<p>https://www.mdpi.com/2072-666X/10/11/734/htm</p>"},{"location":"resources/PACE_PANCE/","title":"Phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE) and Phage-assisted noncontinuous evolution (PANCE)","text":""},{"location":"resources/PACE_PANCE/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>Phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE) and its noncontinuous variant (PANCE), developed by Esvelt et al. 2011<sup>1</sup>. This method offers the possibility to continuously mutate and select proteins with the help of M13 bacteriophages. Effectively, within the PACE process M13 is allowed to propagate whenever the gene of interest (GOI), which is incorporated into the phage genome, is active. PACE is one of a few directed evolution methods which are continuous. Non-continuous evolution methods usually start with the diversification of the target, then functional mutants from the library are selected. These functional mutants can then be used as a basis for the next round of diversification to improve their properties. Continuous evolution methods enable an uninterrupted diversification and selection of the target and thus promise faster results. For PACE more than 100 rounds of selection can be performed within 2 weeks (Miller et al. 2020). So why don\u2019t we use continuous evolution methods all the time? Continuous evolution methods are usually very complex to set-up. The crucial condition to make continuous evolution work is to apply selection pressure onto the GOI and not to the host organism. Some methods do so by introducing targeted mutagenesis methods (e.g. EvolvR (Halperin et al. 2018) or error-prone DNA-polymerases (Camps et al. 2013) or T7 RNA-polymerase systems (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0331-8)). In PACE, the target gene is encoded by an M13 phage and the selection pressure is applied to Escherichia coli cells (Badran et al. 2015). So how does PACE work? For PACE M13 bacteriophages are used, the same are used in Phage Display(link). M13 phages infect E. coli and establish a \u2018chronic infection\u2019 with an average generation time around 15 min (Barbas et al. 2001). The phage consists of a single-strand DNA genome encapsulated by five coat proteins. The coat protein relevant for PACE is pIII, which is essential for phage infectivity.  The basic principle of PACE is to replace the CDS of the pIII coat proteins by the CDS of the target gene which shall be evolved. The pIII gene is located on an accessory plasmid and its expression is activated in response to the activity of the protein of interest. Thus the only phage that bears a functioning protein of interest is allowed to propagate in the culture. Furthermore, the E. coli cells carry a mutagenesis plasmid which enables ongoing mutation of the selection phage. Through this set-up, two possible scenarios can happen when the selection phage infects a cell: The selection phage already carries a functional target gene or the mutation plasmid causes mutations which are beneficial for target functionality resulting in the target gene enabling pIII expression and infectious phages are produced and assembled, which can then infect other cells The selection phage carries a non-functional target gene or the mutation plasmid introduces mutations which inhibit the target functionality resulting in the target gene not enabling pIII expression and no infectious phages are produced In theory, PACE does not represent a method for targeted mutation since usually whole-genome mutators are used. However, due to the fast replication rate of the phages, the phages have a higher mutation rate and even if a selection plasmid is mutated and \u201cwrong\u201d phages are produced, these will be selected in the cells they infect next. PACE is usually performed in a continuous cultivation set-up. In this set-up, the E. coli host cells are cultivated as a fed-batch cultivation and these host cells are used as feed for the actual cultivation where the evolution happens \u2013 the lagoon. In the lagoon, the phages are able to replicate under a continuous feed of the host cells and a continuous outflow of waste (phages and cells). </p> <p>To better understand the basic principle, we will take a look at an example project using PACE: The evolution of a T7-RNA polymerase to recognize another promoter described by Esvelt et al. 2011. To evolve the polymerase, the CDS of pIII was replaced by the CDS of the T7-polymerase. The plasmid responsible for the selection pressure carried the CDS of pIII downstream of a T3/T7 hybrid promoter.  The selection phages are replicated using a strain that can express pIII, producing functional phages with genomes encoding the T7-RNA polymerase CDS. These phages can then infect the cells carrying the plasmid with pIII under the control of the T3/T7 hybrid promoter. If the mutation plasmid introduces mutations that enable the polymerase to recognize the new promoter, pIII is expressed and functional phages are assembled. These phages can then infect new host cells and will be mutated and selected again.  Next to the T7-RNA polymerase, directed evolution using PACE has been used to evolve for example TALE array proteins (Hubbard et al. 2015), Cas9 variants (Hu et al. 2018; Miller et al. 2020), protein-protein interactions using a two-hybrid system (Badran et al. 2016), tRNA/aminoacyl-synthetases (Bryson et al. 2017), and base-editors (Thuronyi et al. 2019).</p> <p>So what are the requirements and challenges using PACE to evolve your protein of choice? A very detailed protocol about requirements, how to set-up, and troubleshoot PACE (and PANCE) experiments is published by Miller et al. 2020.  In short: The crucial condition to use PACE is that the functionality of the target protein needs to be linkable to pIII expression.  Furthermore, the start of the directed evolution process can pose a challenge. When the target protein has little or no activity, even after mutation by the selection plasmid, the phages can be washed out of the continuous system. In this case, an adaption of the selection pressure or a switch to phage-assisted non-continuous evolution (PANCE) are possible choices. PANCE, in general, is probably the easier method when getting started with phage-assisted evolution, since it avoids the set-up of the continuous cultivation set-up.</p>"},{"location":"resources/PACE_PANCE/#references","title":"References","text":"<p>Badran, A.

In recent years, different computational methods have emerged that take advantage of the thousands of sequences and structures deposited in gene and protein databases. Comprehensive reviews of these computational tools have been recently published (Damborsky and Brezovsky, 2014; Sebestova et al., 2014, Sequeiros-Borja et al., 2020), so here we will simply mention a few representative examples of the most common computational algorithms used to date. https://academic.oup.com/bib/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bib/bbaa150/5879227?login=true</p> <p>SCHEMA: This computational method allows libraries to be designed by recombination of several homologous sequences (with as little as 55 % identity) while maximizing the number of folded proteins (Voigt et al., 2002). SCHEMA predicts the fragments that must be inherited in the same parent, thereby allowing the computational selection of blocks from which novel proteins (chimeras) can be assembled. The selection of crossover locations is based on a metric for disruption, defined as the number of interactions of a hybrid protein that are broken when a given pattern of fragments is inherited from each of the parents (ie, the pairs of residues within 4.5 \u00c5 of each other that are not present as the same pair in any of the parents\u2014defined as SCHEMA energy). This method requires a multiple sequence alignment of the parental sequences, a PDB file, and a UNIX-based computer.

MAP is used to predict the quality of the mutant library based on the epPCR method chosen and the nucleotide composition of the target gene. It works at three levels of information using three distinct indicators: (1) the protein structure indicator provides data about the likelihood of introducing stop codons and residues that destabilize the helical structure (Pro, Gly), (2) the amino acid diversity indicator shows the proportion of variants with preserved amino acids (ie, amino acids that do not change with a single nucleotide substitution\u2014silent mutations\u2014) and the average number of amino acid substitutions after a single nucleotide change, and (3) the chemical diversity indicator provides the chemical diversity generated in terms of amino acid substitution (aliphatic, aromatic, neutral, charged). The new version of the server (MAP2.0 3D) permits further mapping of the sequence indicators onto the target protein\u2019s 3D structure, correlating the pattern of amino acid substitution with structural information regarding local interactions solvent accessibility, residual motility, and secondary elements.

Considering its broad modeling capabilities, Rosetta consistently ranks highly when compared to other leading methods created for highly specialized protein modeling and design tasks. Developed for over two decades by a global community of scientists at more than 60 institutions, Rosetta has undergone multiple refactorings, and now comprises over three million lines of code. Among its many uses, the most common applications are: Predicting protein structures; modeling protein\u2013protein and DNA/RNA-protein complexes; design/modeling antibodies and other immune system proteins;  designing new proteins and functions. A limitation of Rosetta is the need for a local installation and compilation in a Unix-like environment. Webservers provide a user-friendly alternative and a number of independent servers have emerged in our community. However, implementing and maintaining such servers comes at a substantial cost. To make it easier to provide protocols webservers, ROSIE (Rosetta Online Server that Includes Everyone) (http://rosie.rosettacommons.org/) implements a simple framework for \u201cserverification\u201d of protocols.

By building models directly from data, machine learning has proven to be a powerful, efficient, and versatile tool for a variety of applications, such as extracting abstract concepts from text and images or beating humans at our most complex games (11, 12). Previous applications of machine learning in protein engineering have identified beneficial mutations (13) and optimal combinations of protein fragments (14) for increased enzyme activity and protein stability, as reviewed recently (15).  Example/Application: Here we use machine learning to enhance directed evolution by using combinatorial libraries of mutations to explore sequence space more efficiently than conventional directed evolution with single mutation walks. The size of a mutant library grows exponentially with the number of residues considered for mutation and quickly becomes intractable for experimental screening. However, by leveraging in silico models built based on sampling of a combinatorial library, machine learning assists directed evolution to make multiple mutations simultaneously and traverse fitness landscapes more efficiently. In the machine learning-assisted directed evolution strategy presented here, multiple amino acid residues are randomized in each generation. Sequence\u2013function information sampled from the large combinatorial library is then used to predict a restricted library with an increased probability of containing variants with high fitness. The best-performing variants from the predicted libraries are chosen as the starting points for the next round of evolution, from which further improved variants are identified.  https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/18/8852.full.pdf</li> </ol> <p>A good and concise example of combining computational and experimental approaches: In our last example, a good combination of dry and wetlab was employed. The IPTG responsive Transcription Factor LacI has been computationally redesigned and mutated to recognize four new non-native inducers (Taylor et al., 2016). This study is a good example of how the combination of computation-guided mutagenesis based on the Rosetta algorithm and different diversification techniques (such as epPCR and saturation mutagenesis) can accelerate the discovery/generation of new molecular functions. In a counter-selection round, the mutant libraries were pre-screened for retained ability to repress a TolC reporter (a porin that allows entry of toxic colicin E1) by growth enrichment in the absence of inducers but in the presence of colicin E1. The enriched LacI libraries were then positively screened by FACS for their ability to activate production of GFP upon induction with different sugars, resulting in variants of LacI that were responsive to fucose, gentiobiose, lactitol and sucralose (Taylor et al., 2016). In this instance, no active counter-screening was performed against activation by IPTG, so nearly all mutants retained their ability to respond to IPTG, a phenotype that was reduced for some designs upon shuffling of mutations for activity screening. https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/48/1/e3/5645005?login=true</p> <p>Reviews Computational tools for enzyme improvement: why everyone can \u2013 and should \u2013 use them https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1367593117300248 Computational Tools for Designing Smart Libraries https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007%2F978-1-4939-1053-3_20 Protein computational design - recent review https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0734975021000021 From directed evolution to computational enzyme engineering\u2014A review https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aic.16847 Other examples: CADEE: Computer-Aided Directed Evolution of Enzymes https://journals.iucr.org/m/issues/2017/01/00/be5274/index.html Machine learning-assisted directed protein evolution with combinatorial libraries https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/18/8852.full.pdf Principles of Machine Learning Guided Protein Engineering https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/37365914 Discovery of Novel Gain-of-Function Mutations Guided by Structure-Based Deep Learning https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00345 Deep Dive into Machine Learning Models for Protein Engineering https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.0c00073 Underrated Machine Learning Papers for Protein Design https://medium.com/proteinqure/underrated-machine-learning-papers-for-protein-design-applications-a846e294330 Deep Learning in Protein Structural Modeling and Design https://www.cell.com/patterns/pdf/S2666-3899(20)30190-2.pdf</p>"},{"location":"resources/cont_de_methods/","title":"Continuous directed evolution methods","text":"<p>Continuous directed evolution (CDE) methods offer a significant advantage over the discrete ones as they:</p> <ul> <li>Involve less interrogation from the experimenter.

In the late 90s, the group of Jack Szostak realised that puromycin can be linked to an oligonucleotide which, in turn, can also be ligated to mRNA.

In this technique, a gene encoding a protein of interest (POI) is expressed in frame (i.e. as a fusion) with the phage coat protein gene, causing the phage to \"display\" the protein on its outside. The phage itself serves as a 'vessel' connecting the displayed phenotype and genotype. The displaying phages can then be screened against various bait molecules (proteins, peptides or DNA sequences) for specific interaction with them. In this way, large libraries of proteins can be screened and amplified in a process called in vitro selection. The most common bacteriophages used in phage display are M13 and FD filamentous phage, though T4, T7, and \u03bb phage are also used.</p>"},{"location":"resources/phage_display/#general-principle","title":"General principle.","text":"<p>In the M13 phage display, the DNA encoding POI is expressed N-terminally with either pIII or pVIII gene, which encodes the minor and major coat proteins. The pIII gene is responsible for binding to E.coli via associating with the F' pilus thereby triggering infection. Certain E.coli strains are suitable for this purpose: TG1, SS320, ER2738, or XL1-Blue. Fusing POI to the pIII N-terminus ensures correct exposure of a target peptide for the interaction with a bait molecule. The POIs of sizes less than 50 amino acids largely don't affect the main function of the coat protein - phage infectivity. For larger POIs a \"phagemid\" vector is used (a simplified display construct vector) that encodes a fused version of the coat-protein with the intact coat protein (and other phage lifecyle-components) provided by a helper phage. Upon infection, intact pIII competes with POI-pIII fusion resulting in a large portion of the phage population not displaying POI and a small portion that would contain on average a single copy of POI-pIII per phage particle. Use of phagemid is beneficial in two ways: (1) smaller vector enables higher transformation efficiency hence higher genetic diversity libraries; (2) use of monovalent display of POI on phages often results in selection of higher affinity binders due to the absence of an 'avidity' effect.</p> <p></p> <p>The bait molecules are typically immobilised on the surface of a microtiter plate. Phages that tightly interact with the bait will remain attached to the plate while the majority of the phage population will be washed away. The remaining phage are then eluted and amplified again in the next round of bacterial infection resulting in a phage mixture enriched with phages that bind the target molecule. This process is referred to as panning is typically repeated a number of times to establish high level of enrichment of phages encoding tight-binder POIs.

Elution is usually carried out by using trypsin to digest the bait protein and presented binding protein, thus releasing the bound phage, or by using low pH buffer to dissociate electrostatic interactions.

Team members will be able to add themselves as collaborators to the wiki repository through reg.idec.io and upload their web contents. Write access to the repository will be revoked by wiki freeze.  </p> <p>We intend to give as much control as possible to teams in styling their project wikis and project documentations. For this reason, we are setting up GitHub repositories so that teams can display their wikis using GitHub Pages.</p> <p>iDEC teams are encouraged to be creative and to fully utilize the freedom that comes with the assigned GitHub repository.</p> <p>If you are not familiar with the concept of Git and GitHub, imagine the following scenario:  </p> <p>We are hosting a blog (iDEC HQ repository) that we write essays. You read some contents on your blog and you felt that something should change, so you downloaded (forked and cloned) a copy of our blog posts, made some edits (commits) on your own copy (your repository) and kept a chronological record of what and how edits are made (a history of commmits). Then, you send a note (pull request) to us, with those edits (but not the modified blog posts) attached. We reviewed the note, checked if the changes are reasonable or necessary, and decided to carry out (merge) the changes on our original blog posts.  </p> <p>Moreover, in some ocassions, you might write a slightly different copy of the original blog post, and you wish to keep a copy of both the original text (trunk) and the derived text (branch). Instead of saving the derived text, you save how the derived text is different. You then continue working on the original text and when the moment comes, you can choose to apply the changes back onto main verison of the text. Abstractly, this is like a tree, with a main trunk that develops upwards with different smaller changes branching out from the trunk.</p> <p>This is a simplified analogy on how software enigneers use distributed version control to collaborate on projects. This year, iDEC HQ will provide the wiki platform through this mechanism. So essentially, we will assign each team an iDEC HQ-owned repository, which is basically a cloud space for hosting web contents. The contents will be rendered as a publicly accessible websie through the GitHub Pages function.  </p>"},{"location":"team_wiki/setup_wiki/#wiki-content-upload-and-wiki-freeze","title":"Wiki content upload and wiki freeze","text":"<p>A team will be given permissions to manage their assigned repository.
